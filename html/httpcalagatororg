        <p>How Do Cultural Differences Play Into Agile Practices?</p>


<p> </p><p>Whether you have a diverse team, a group of people from around the US or work with users around the world, culture matters. Cultural assumptions change how you communicate and how you build trust. So, how do these differences play into your agile practices? "Does Individuals and interactions over processes and tools" makes sense in every culture?</p> <p>Bring your culture + agile puzzles (or solutions) and we will learn together.</p> <p>Events are made possible by the AgilePDX community and our sponsors, including platinum sponsor ProFocus Technology (<a href="https://www.profocustechnology.com/" class="linkified">https://www.profocustechnology.com/</a>).

        <p>Mondo Croquet – it's croquet, American style with bowling balls and sledgehammers!</p>

<p>Hey, we've been doing this since 1997, and your gramma says HI!</p>

<p>What:
Bring a bowling ball and a sledgehammer.  Don’t worry if you don’t have, we’ve got plenty of extras to loan out
You’ll enjoy yourself more if you’re dressed appropriately in lawn whites, or Mad Hatter gear, or simply appropriately inappropriate.  Peruse some of our photos for ideas.
Bring along something to share for the picnic and something cold to drink.
…and you might want a chair.
It’s a smashing time.  Tell your friends!  Taunt your enemies!</p>

The group will be encouraged to ask questions, voice their challenges and participate in helpful discussions.</p>

<p>This month's topic will be "Staying Ahead of the Curve with Digital Marketing Trends". We will spend a majority portion of the event with an engaging panel discussion between digital marketing gurus from local Portland companies, Columbia Sportswear, Wieden+Kenndey, and Anvil Media. This discussion will cover much of the digital marketing world as we explore changes happening within social media, SEO, and creative design and arm entrepreneurs with tools to stay adaptable.</p>      </div>

        <p>Hey everybody. Got a bug you just can't land? Is there a recent CVE you've been eyeballing seductively? Just want to brush up on your APPSEC or OPSEC? Do none of the above questions make any sense, but you're interested in computer security?</p>


<p> </p><p>PDX Exploit Workshop is the longest running security meetup in Portland (10 years!). It's an open, self driven event for people interested in computer security. Whether you're a novice or career professional, all are welcome. It's always a good time to learn about security!</p> <p>We spend this dedicated time each week researching and exploring topics of software and hardware security as well as working on personal and group projects. Occasionally we have presentations on our findings. Bring a willingness to learn, a curiosity about security, and/or a specific area of interest to share with others.</p> <p>This group meets in the PDX Hackerspace mainspace which has comfy seating, deluxe wifi (thanks Kyle!), Club Mate soda in the snack shack, and hackable LED displays to play around with.</p> <p>p.s. This event is open to everyone! No ^H membership is required to attend. All are welcome. That means you!</p>      </div>

We are unifying a supportive environment for current and potential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other. Our goal is to bring together and empower women in tech and to encourage others to pursue tech careers. This is our step towards reducing the gender imbalance in the industry and addressing the current negative effects of that imbalance on women.</p>

        <p>As agile practitioners our role is to encourage individuals and organizations to practice the values of transparency and communication. In our journeys we may find that honesty, integrity and transparency are easier to do through conversations with individuals rather than open dialogue across organizational units. We need to find tools and techniques to live into these values and inspire leaders on how to manifest honesty and openness in every conversation not just the individual ones.</p>


<p> </p><p>Come together and discuss this topic with us at Ringlers Pub on Friday the 2nd of August. We want to know your experience.

        <p>This month’s speaker: Erik Nordin (@ObliqueMotion)</p>

<p>Tonight we'll take a look into Rust’s most straightforward smart pointer, Box, examining some practical scenarios in which Box is extremely useful and often necessary. Though the overall focus will be on Box, we will touch on other subjects like generics, trait bounds, iterators, enums, structs, and more. Bring a laptop and join us for this beginner-friendly follow-along-style presentation with live coding. All are welcome. It will be “heaps” of fun!</p>

<p>Erik Nordin is a CS student at Portland State University (PSU). He is finishing his last two school terms and graduating with a B.S. in Computer Science this December. Erik first started programming in Rust exactly one year ago when he took Bart Massey’s summer Rust course at PSU.</p>      </div>

        <p>Hey everybody. Got a bug you just can't land? Is there a recent CVE you've been eyeballing seductively? Just want to brush up on your APPSEC or OPSEC? Do none of the above questions make any sense, but you're interested in computer security?</p>


<p> </p><p>PDX Exploit Workshop is the longest running security meetup in Portland (10 years!). It's an open, self driven event for people interested in computer security. Whether you're a novice or career professional, all are welcome. It's always a good time to learn about security!</p> <p>We spend this dedicated time each week researching and exploring topics of software and hardware security as well as working on personal and group projects. Occasionally we have presentations on our findings. Bring a willingness to learn, a curiosity about security, and/or a specific area of interest to share with others.</p> <p>This group meets in the PDX Hackerspace mainspace which has comfy seating, deluxe wifi (thanks Kyle!), Club Mate soda in the snack shack, and hackable LED displays to play around with.</p> <p>p.s. This event is open to everyone! No ^H membership is required to attend. All are welcome. That means you!</p>      </div>

        <p>NOTE: Proceeds from ticket sales for this workshop go to Lean Portland in support of our volunteer efforts with nonprofits.</p>

<p>Whether you work for a manufacturing company, work in an office, or provide customer service, Six Sigma can help you solve important and challenging problems within your organization, using a structured approach and data analysis.</p>

<p>In this Six Sigma primer we’ll address: - How the DMAIC model and analysis tools increase the chance of solving problems - The different Six Sigma belt certification levels (Yellow, Green, Black and Master Black Belt) - Popular analysis tools such as graphical tools, designed experiments (DOE), measurement studies, statistical process control, regression analysis and statistical software - How Six Sigma compares to Lean - Examples of Six Sigma applied to sustainability (environmental and social) - Exercises for measuring time and conducting experiments</p>

<p>Join Brion Hurley from Business Performance Improvement to better understand how Six Sigma can be integrated into your organization.</p>

<p>Roots of Six Sigma In 1986, engineers Bill Smith &amp; Mikel J Harry introduced Six Sigma within Motorola, as a way to improve business performance, and make it easier for employees to utilize effective quality improvement tools.</p>

<p>Why did Motorola come up with this program? It all began in the late 1970s, when a Japanese firm took over a Motorola factory that manufactured television sets in the United States. The Japanese promptly set about making drastic changes to the way the factory operated by reducing the variation from product to product. The factory was soon producing TV sets with 1/20th the number of defects they had produced under Motorola management, and this translated to fewer warranty claims and customer complaints.</p>

<p>Six Sigma refers to the ability of processes to produce a very high proportion of output within specification (without defects or errors). Processes that operate with "six sigma quality" over the short term are assumed to produce long-term defect levels below 3.4 defects per million opportunities.</p>

<p>After Motorola achieved tremendous quality improvements, the popularity spread to other companies. Jack Welch, CEO of General Electric (GE) made it integral to his business strategy in 1995, requiring his managers to achieve Green Belt certification if they wanted to get promoted.</p>

<p>By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality. Today, Six Sigma continues to be practiced and implemented within many manufacturing, banking, healthcare, service and financial organizations.</p>
